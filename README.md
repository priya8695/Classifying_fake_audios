## üîç Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting audio deepfakes ‚Äî distinguishing between real human speech and AI-generated voices using the **ASVspoof2019-LA** dataset. Leveraging deep learning models, including a custom **CNN-LSTM** hybrid, we achieved **99% accuracy** in classifying audio as *bonafide* (real) or *spoof* (fake).

## üìå Motivation

With the rise of AI voice cloning, audio-based fraud is becoming a real threat. Incidents such as a $35M fraudulent bank transfer highlight the urgency to develop **audio spoofing detection** systems.

Our goal is to provide a practical solution for identifying fake audios in real-time through machine learning.
